This is an example of the strategy design pattern in C++. It is based on an example found in Head First Design Patterns and on an implementation of the observer design pattern found here: 
https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer/cpp/example#example-0

Compiling and Running:
The files provided in the .vscode folder should be sufficient to allow this program to run provided that the compiler path has been set.
Alternatively the makefile can be used to compile each class into its own object file and then into a single executable.
If none of these options works, running g++ *.cpp should generate a working executable file.

Here are some notes that I thought were important about its implementatation.

If you unregister the observer you can reregister it with a pointer.
