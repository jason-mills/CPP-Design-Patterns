This is an example of the strategy design pattern in C++. It is based on an example found in Head First Design Patterns and on an implementation of the observer design pattern found here:

Compiling and Running:
The files provided in the .vscode folder should be sufficient to allow this program to run provided that the compiler path has been set.
Alternatively the makefile can be used to compile an executable.

Here are some notes that I thought were important about its implementatation.

If you unregister the observer you can reregister it with a pointer.

As a general rule you need a virtual destructor if you have a class with a virtual method.
