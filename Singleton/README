This is an example of the singleton design pattern in C++. It is based on an example found in Head First Design Patterns and on implementations of the singleton design pattern found here:

Compiling and Running:
The files provided in the .vscode folder should be sufficient to allow this program to run provided that the compiler path has been set.
Alternatively the makefile can be used to compile into an executable.

Here are some notes that I thought were important about its implementation.

Despite the simplicity of this pattern there seems to be much discussion about how it should be implemented see below:

I chose not to use the medium article's strategy of using atomic operations for simplicity. However, if I were going to use it for real I would look at performance with and without the atomic operations.

ChoclateBoiler uses the mutex singleton approach.
AltBoiler uses the Meyers apptoach.
