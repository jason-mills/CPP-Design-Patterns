This is an example of the command design pattern in C++. It is based on an example found in Head First Design Patterns.

Compiling and Running:
The files provided in the .vscode folder should be sufficient to allow this program to run provided that the compiler path has been set.
Alternatively the makefile can be used to compile each class into an executable.

Here are some notes I thought were important about its impleentation.

The implementation here is near identical to the Java version found in HFDS. The key difference being the use of pointers as this is C++.
The implementation here is simple enough that basic pointers are sufficient. In another use case I could see it necessary to allocate memory in order to make this pattern work.
