This is an example of the Facade design pattern in C++. It is based on an exmple found in Head First Design Patterns.

Compiling and Running:
The files provided in the .vscode folder should be sufficient to allow this program to run provided that the compiler path has been set.
Alternatively the makefile can be used to compile an executable.

Here are some notes that I thought were important about its implementation.

I would not personally differentiate between the Facade and Adapter Pattern. Both simply use interfaces to hide some complexity. Head First Design Patterns differentiates between the two by the level of complexity that they hide. HFDS claims that the Adapter is more linked to connecting exiting behavior to an interface whereas the Facade is more about providing a simplified way to use a number of components. Again, I would not differentiate. Seems we are just hiding complexity. Still, I provide this example for completeness.
