This is an example of the factory design pattern in C++. It is based on an example found in Head First Design Patterns.

Compiling and Running: 
The files provided in the .vscode folder should be sufficient to allow this program to run provided that the compiler path has been set.
Alternatively the makefil can be used to compile each class into its own object file and then into a single executable.
If none of these options works, running g++ *.cpp PizzaStores/*.cpp Pizzas/ChicagoStylePizzas/*.cpp Pizzas/NYStylePizzas/*.cpp should work.

Here are some notes that I thought were important about its implementation.

The implementation found here is very similar to the Java version found in Head First Design Patterns. The only major difference is that because this is C++ you must use pointers to implement the pattern. Otherwise the code is near one-to-one.
