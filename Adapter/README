This is an example of the adapter design pattern in C++. It is based on an exmple found in Head First Design Patterns.

Compiling and Running:
The files provided in the .vscode folder should be sufficient to allow this program to run provided that the compiler path has been set.
Alternatively the makefile can be used to compile an executable.

Here are some notes that I thought were important about its implementation.

I would not personally define this as a "design pattern". The only thing we are doing here is making a class provide the methods that are specified by an interface. If you are using interfaces in your design this is a natural consequence.
